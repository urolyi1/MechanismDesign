This is an attempt at using [cvxpylayers](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpylayers) and the [RegretNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03459) adversarial learning approach to learn strategyproof mechanisms for kidney exchange (and conceivably other matching problems that can be relaxed to convex optimization problems).
